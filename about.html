          <h2>My Story</h2>

          <p>
            My interest in computers started in high school. My senior year of high school I took an html class and did a few things with making music on computers. I didn't have much of a knack for making music with computers but I really enjoyed doing the html class. This was back in 2000 before CSS even became popular. So I didn't have too much experience with it before I came to Epicodus.
          </p>

          <p>
            I went to DeVry for a few semsters but I didn't really like the program and I wasn't really in a good mindset at the time to I just sort of slacked off. I ended up with a hugh student loan debt and not much to show for it. After that I tried going to a community collage but that didn't work out either due to my continued mindset. During that time I did teach myself some PHP and mySQL, but most of that I have forgotten since I haven't used it in a long time.
          </p>

          <p>
            After I gave up on going to school I basically took a year off from life and mostly played video games in my room at my parents house. My dad eventually got fed up with my slacking and told me to go find a job. So I entered the working world in 2004 as a 411 operator at Verizon for mobile phones. I worked there for 4 years without much incident other then not liking the job.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2007 I met my wife. We where both on Yahoo Personals and they required you to make a different username so they could try and charge you for contacting people. However my wife being very talented was able to figure out my real Yahoo username and contacted me directly. So I jokingly call her my 'stalker' every now and then.
          </p>

          <p>
            We dated for a few months then she went to school at San Francisco State so we did the long distance relationship. She flew down and visited me one time and I flew up to San Francisco and visited her twice. During her summer break we both decided we didn't want to do the long distance thing anymore so we just decided to get married. We had a wedding at the Norwalk Court House in July of 2008. After that we both moved to San Francisco.
          </p>

          <p>
            My wife had a friend who was already living in the San Francisco area so we stayed with him until we found our own place. We were able to find a very affordable 1 bedroom apartment near her friend for $950 a month, which was a good deal even by 2008 standards. Laura (my wife) eventually graduated and found a job and I eventually got a job doing dispatching.
          </p>

          <p>
            San Francisco being the way it was finally caught up to my wife and I. Our apartment was eventually sold and the new owners of course jacked up the rent so we had to find a new apartment. We eventually ended up getting a 2 bedroom, 1 bath apartment with my wife's friend with the goal that we would save up so we can move away from the area eventually.
          </p>

          <p>
            After saving up for about a year we moved to Portland in 2016. Our friend moved back to his family in New Jersey which was great for him because his sister had just had a baby and he wanted to be part of the kids life. Neither Laura or I had jobs lined up before we moved but we made the best of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Laura was finally able to find a decent job working at Epiq making legal forms. I found a job at Jacob's Heating being a Dispatcher since I've been doing it since 2011 at this point. All was going well for us and we where finally able to start paying off debt!
          </p>

          <p>
            Things took a turn for the worst in 2018. Laura and I decided to take a weeklong cruise to Alaska for our 10 year wedding anniversary. The cruise was awesome but while on vacation the owner of Jacobs heating thought that my co-worker did a really great job of filling in for me. A few months after I got back from vacation I got fired from Jacobs because the owner wanted my co-worker in the dispatching position. So I've been unemployed since August of 2018.
          </p>

          <p>
            After much thinking and pondering I decided that I should trying and change careers because dispatching is mostly a dead-end job. After talking it over with Laura we decided that I should try and get back into programming so I started reading some coding books and doing the courses on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank"> freecodecamp.com</a>. I remembered how much I liked coding before and looked into coding schools. <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/" target="_blank"> Epicodus</a> came up with very good reviews and both my wife and I really like that the program includes an intership. So now I'm here working on becomming a better programmer.

            <h2 class="biggertext">My Current Interests</h2>
            <p>
              Currently I'm interested in developing my programming skills. I read <em><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159924.do" target="_blank">Head First HTML and CSS</a></em> book before starting at Epicodus to give myself a better understanding before starting the program. This proved to be invauluable since the first week of class was pretty easy after reading this book and from my previous experience with HTML. I was able going to read <em><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027065.do" target="_blank">Head First JavaScript</a></em> and <em><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010906.do" target="_blank">Head First HTML 5 Programming</a></em> but I ran out of time. I do own the books though.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm looking forward to complete the program at Epicodus and starting a programming career. Laura's 2 bothers are both programmers and one of them is my mentor, he is a back end developer. I think I might learn Python after Epicodus because my wife will eventually need it to advance at her current job and that way I'll be able to teach it to her.
