            This project was done on 01/08/19 my second day of class. It was a fun project I worked on with Ryan Dikeos. We praticed branching with this project I styled the <em>'sane'</em> branch and Ryan styled the <em>'insane'</em> branch.

            This project was done on 01/10/19 it was a very interesting project as it introduced me to bootstrap.css. Jared Farkas was my partner and he understood the concepts very quickly and we were able to make a pretty decent replica of the Wikipedia home page. Its held together mostly by duct tape and hope though, if you make the viewport small enough it totally messes up and the "not logged in" part doesn't scale with the rest of the page.
